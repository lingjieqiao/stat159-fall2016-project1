# stat159-fall2016-project1

### Lingjie Qiao's first reproducible project

This project aims to utilize what we have so far learned in Statistics 159 - Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science and write a paper upon how the concepts are developed.

The following concepts are discussed in detail through the paper:

## 2. Discussion


As the course title, "Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science", suggested, reproducibility and collaboration are two main focuses of present research projects that enable us to make meaningful use of other's works built upon collective ideas. With that said, creating a **public repository**, instead of a private one, on Github is a crucial part of the project's reproducibility. As we learned from recent reproducibility crisis, it is important to make the source, code, documentation public in order for others to prove your work's correctness and make meaningful use of the results. Therefore, the content of this paper as well as citation and documentation are all public in my Github repository so that everyone can question or challenge the concepts here and learn from my discovery.

To get the paper formatted and compiled, I did a lot of online searches on the exact meaning of each term, trying to translate these technical meanings in my own language so that readers can get a more practical and personal understanding. Utilizing information from wikipedia, software tool official website/documentation and related journals, I developed a more comprehensive understanding in formulating my ideas. I also communicated a lot with my classmates in order to find potential misunderstandings and consulted with our GSI on how to get started with makefile and pandoc. With these conversations, I am able to make progress and fully explain the underlying ideas.

#### 2.1 Basics

The relatively easy part of this project is the real use of all software tools (pandoc, git and markdown language etc.). The reason we can write about how we write the paper is the fact that we developed a good understanding of the writing process. Therefore, with GSI's instructions and Professor's clarification of concepts in classes, it is not difficult for us to actually use these tools to efficiently produce our work. In addition, since the project structure is provided, it is not difficult to follow the instructions and create the exact same workflow, which is something we should learn and refer to in future paper writing.

#### 2.2 Challenges

The most challenging part of this project so far is to formalize my thoughts and actions in producing the paper and explaining concepts in the most concrete/understandable manner. Since everyone can conduct Google search and find the official definition online, I hope to provide a slightly different perspective by showing how these concepts/tools are used in my own project. 

At the same time, when writing the paper, I gradually realized how superficial my understanding was to some of the tools. With limited information, we only have a general big picture of what the tool is and how it works. However, we do not really understand the tools to the extent of best utilizing it and cannot answer detailed questions regarding its role, usage and usefulness compared with other similar tools. For example, while I am familiar with using git and confident in `add` and `commit`, I nevertheless spent a long time figuring out how to undo the wrong commit messages and undo changes in general. Efficiency and time-saving are important in performing larger projects. We therefore need to take initiatives to learn more about the tools in order to produce the satisfying results in a timely, error-clean manner.

#### 2.3 Project Timeline

I started this project from creating folders in the local repository and gradually pushed my work to the Github repository. It overall takes me around 10 hours in finishing this project, plus the learning hours in class and in lab.

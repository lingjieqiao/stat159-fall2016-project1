## Abstract

Summarizing and utlizing the computational tools that we learned in the first month of Statistics 159, this paper discussed the main processes of producing a paper. Some main concepts include **Git**, **Github**, **Makefile**, **pandoc**, and **Markdown**. 

The goal is to show how each tool is being used - its advantages, usefulness and role in the project as well as how easy it is to make use of the tool - to give beginners in statistical computation a basic understanding of the reproducing process. 

This paper doesn't aim to copy and paste the technical definition of the terms. Rather, it is about explaining the author's own experienece and providing personal feedbacks and reflections on how using these tools will help the reproducing process easier and more efficient.

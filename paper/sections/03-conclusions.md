## 3. Conclusion

To conclude, this project helps me to develop a better and more comprehensive understanding of the computation tools, such as git, github, pandoc, markdown and makefile, that assist the reproducible procedure and lay down the basic foundation for large projects. Some new things I learned from this project are:

* Commit more with good commit messages such that it is easier to track your changes in the future
* Utilize tools and platforms that encourage open source and public sharing practice such that more people can benefit from individual works
* Explore and learn concepts through online searches and discussion with instructors/classmates to build ideas collectively

Only if we can flexibly and comfortably use these tools will we be able to deal with more complicated projects and efficiently perform the reproducible work. It matches the initial goal of this course such that "students learn practical techniques and tools for producing statistically sound and appropriate, reproducible, and verifiable computational answers to scientific questions." We should therefore familiarize ourselves not only with the tools/concepts, but also the idea of reproducibility and collaboration so that we can implement these tools to achieve the desired results.
